## About Me
Hi, I'm Jayden Fullerton, a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at the University of Washington, also pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I love developing because I find problem solving very fun, and love solving difficult issues regarding math and programming/algorithms. I'm currently aspiring to be a software developer, and hope to find an internship while I'm still in college.

Linux, MacOS

*Development Tools*:
Visual Studio 2019, Eclipse, Unity, PyCharm, Easy68K

*Project Management Tools*:
Trello, Google Drive, GitHub

*Other Tools*:
LaTeX, Microsoft Word

## Projects

### Auto-tuner (MATLAB)
We explored creating a utility in matlab that processes an audio file and corrects the pitch to a desired frequency using MATLAB. This involved using a Short-Term Fourier Transform and other signal processing/computer vision techniques. An in-depth report can be found on the website.

### Monster Defender (Unity with C#)
Monster Defender is a tower defense strategy game where you have to place towers to defeat all the monsters. The player defends against seven monster waves that will randomly spawn in random time increments. If the player defeats all the monsters, they win the game. The goal of this project was to explore the process of making a game, including designing, prototyping, and demoing our game through the various stages of the software development process.

### Hospital Database (SQLITE3)
We explored the process of designing a database from scratch, including creating an ER Diagram and Relational Data Model for our database. Our database was designed to hold hospital information, mainly the interactions between rooms, employees (doctors/nurses), patients, and perscriptions. We then implemented our database with SQLITE3 and added sample data. A report can be found at the link below, which includes the SQLITE3 code to initialize and update the database.

### Image Segmentation (C++)
I used the concept of image segmentation to create a program which segments an image using a recursive algorithm. This helped me learn more about the C++ language, as well as polishing my skills with linked lists and recursion.

### Disassembler (68000 Assembly)
We used the EASy68K simulator to build a reverse assembler that takes binary as input and returns the appropriate Motorola 68000 processor instruction as output. This project required strong programming fundamentals and debugging techniques to properly solve many issues that arose while writing this program.
